    <h2>Let's meet up</h2>
    <p>
      Cancun concentrates talent thanks to it's services and tourism industry, it has one of the most connected airports in Mexico; with direct flights to plenty of destinations, it also counts with white sand beaches and beautiful surroundings along with most large city commodities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are aware that our local ecosystem is small, and that an outsider vantage point is very valuable. We don't want to sell our products, we want to meet up and chat about small or big ideas that might have in mind.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. The LA Times has a recent article on <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/26/news/la-trb-mexico-cancun-spring-break-20130225">safety in Cancun</a> from an ex-pat perspective.
      When in doubt, err on the side of safety.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Should I take dollars or pesos</h3>
    <p>
      You can pay in USD in most places, but you won't receive a good exchange rate. Change your USD/CAD to pesos at a bank in Mexico and you'll get 15%-20% more out of your USD.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Can I manage without knowing Spanish?</h3>
    <p>
      A little bit of Spanish never hurt anybody, but most people here know at least a little bit of English. In tourist areas conversational English is the norm. Locals are usually willing to communicate by whatever means possible.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Is there anything I should be aware about?</h3>
    <p>
      Hustlers gawking souvenirs and wares along Zona Hotelera are often an annoyance. Just ignore and keep on walking.
    </p>
